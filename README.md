# TLCounter
This simple python script will count you, in seconds, the total number of messages you have in each of your conversations. It will also divide them in supergroups/channels
and normal groups/single chats. That's all.

## Downloads

You can always find the latest version of the app in the [Releases tab](https://github.com/TelegramTools/TLCounter/releases)
Binaries for Windows are included and bundled as an .exe executable (thanks to Pyinstaller!). If you want to use this python script in Mac or Linux, you will
be able to, using the compiled binaries also included in the file you will get from the Releases Tab. Make sure that you have Python3 installed and also
Telethon: `pip install telethon`.

## Building sources

Replace the apiID and ApiHash in the python script with your own values obtained in https://my.telegram.org/auth - API Development Tools. I used Visual Studio
as my IDE, but you can use Pycharm or any text editor to edit the script. You can also make a pull request or create a new issue if you had any problem or
have an improvement for TLCounter. It would be appreciated :).

## Credits

This couldn't be possible without [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon), by Lonami, and a also without [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) which I used to build the Windows binaries.
You can't imagine how much fun I had while I was using Telethon, kudos for Lonami for making such a great library! The best one out there!

Also, huge acknowledgements to [Telegram](telegram.org) for making such a great messenger!
